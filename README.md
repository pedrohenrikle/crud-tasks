## Getting Started

To get started with OpenCRUD API, follow these simple steps:

### 1. Installation

First of all, clone the repository and install de dependencies.

```shell
pnpm install
```

### 2. Setting up your environment

Now we must setup our environment variables. Create a file on root as ***.env***. Inside, put all data like is here in: [.env.example](https://github.com/pedrohenrikle/crud-tasks/blob/main/.env.example)

```shell
NODE_ENV=dev

# Auth
JWT_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET_HERE

# Database
DATABASE_URL="path_from_your_database"
```

### 3. Setting up database

Now we must setup our database. We're going to apply the migrations executing the following command:

```shell
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### 4. Run

Now, you can run the API with 

```shell
pnpm run dev
```

## üõë Endpoints

Here you can see all the endpoints of the application. You'll need to use the prefix "/api", so to example: If you want to register a user, use: `[protocol]://[url]/api/users`.

### Users

- ```POST - '/users'```
  - This is the user's entry route, where the user will register with in the application. You must send the request with a ***data*** equal a some user's informations on the body of the requisition. "***name***" is optional.
  <br><br>
